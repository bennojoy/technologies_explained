##Deploying a sharded production ready MongoDB cluster with Ansible
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Requires Ansible 1.2
- Expects CentOS/RHEL 6 hosts

###A Primer into the MongoDB NoSQL database.
---------------------------------------------

![Alt text](/mongodb/images/nosql_primer.png "Primer NoSQL")

The above diagram shows how the MongoDB nosql differs from the traditional
relational database model. In RDBMS the data of a user is stored in table and
the  records of users are stored in rows/columns, While in mongodb the 'table'
is replaced by 'collection' and the individual 'records' are called
'documents'.  One thing also to be noticed is that the data is stored as
key/value pairs in BJSON format.

Another thing to be noticed is that nosql has a looser consistency model, as an
example the second document in the users collection has an additonal field of
'last name'. Due to this flexibility the nosql database model can give us:

Better Horizontal scaling capability.

Also mongodb has inbuilt support for 

Data Replication & HA

Which makes it good choice for users who have very large data to handle and
less requirement for ACID.

 
### MongoDB's Data replication .
------------------------------------

![Alt text](/mongodb/images/replica_set.png "Replica Set")


Data backup is achieved in Mongodb via Replica sets. As the figure above show's
a single replication set consists of a replication master (active) and several
other replications slaves (passive). All the database operations like
Add/Delete/Update happens on the replication master and the master replicates
the data to the slave nodes. mongod is the process which is resposible for all
the database activities as well as replication processes. The minimum
recommended number of slave servers are 3.


### MongoDB's Sharding (Horizontal Scaling) .
------------------------------------------------

![Alt text](/mongodb/images/sharding.png "Sharding")

Sharding allows to achieve a very high performing database, by partioning the
data into seperate chunks and allocating diffent ranges of chunks to diffrent
shard servers. The figure above shows a collection which has 90 documents which
has been sharded across the three shard server, The first shard getting ranges
from 1- 29 etc... . When a client wants to access a certian document it
contacts the query router (mongos process), which inturn would contact the
'configuration node' (lightweight mongod process) which keeps a record of which
ranges of chunks are distributed across which shards. 

Please do note that every shard server should be backed by a replica set, so
that when data is written/queried copies of the data are available. So in a
three shard deployment we would require 3 replica sets and primaries of each
would act as the sharding server.

Here's a basic steps of how sharding works. 

1) A new database is created, and collections are added.

2) New documents get updated as an when clients update, all the new documents
goes into a single shard.

3) when the size of collection in a shard exceeds the 'chunk_size' the
collection is split and balanced across shards.


###Deploy MongoDB cluster via Ansible.
--------------------------------------------

### Deploy the Cluster.
----------------------------

![Alt text](/mongodb/images/site.png "Site")
  
The above diagram illustrates the deployment model for mongodb cluster via
Ansible, This deployment models focuses on deploying a three shard servers,
each having a replica set, the backup replica servers are other two shard
primaries. The configuration server are co-located with the shard's. The mongos
servers are best deployed on seperate servers. These are the minimum recomended
configuration for a production grade mongodb deployment.  Please note that the
playbooks are capable of deploying N node cluster not necesarily three. Also
all the processes are secured using keyfiles.

###Pre-Requisite's

Edit the group_vars/all file to reflect the below variables.

1) iface: 'eth1'     # the interface to be used for all communication.
		
2) Set a unique mongod_port variable in the inventory file for each MongoDB
server.

3) The default directory for storing data is /data, please do change it if
requried, also make sure it has sufficient space 10G recommended.

###Once the pre-requisite's have been done, we can  procced with the site deployment. The following example deploys a three node MongoDB Cluster

The inventory file looks as follows:

		#The site wide list of mongodb servers
		[mongo_servers]
		mongo1 mongod_port=2700
		mongo2 mongod_port=2701
		mongo3 mongod_port=2702

		#The list of servers where replication should happen, including the master server.
		[replication_servers]
		mongo1
		mongo2
		mongo3

		#The list of mongodb configuration servers, make sure it is 1 or 3
		[mongoc_servers]
		mongo1
		mongo2
		mongo3

		#The list of servers where mongos servers would run. 
		[mongosservers]
		mongos1
		mongos2

Build the site with the following command:

		ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml


###Verifying the deployed MongoDB Cluster
---------------------------------------------

Once completed we can check replication set availibitly by connecting to
individual primary replication set nodes, 'mongo --host 192.168.1.1 --port 2700'
and issue the command to query the status of replication set, we should get a
similar output.

		
		web2:PRIMARY> rs.status()
		{
			"set" : "web2",
			"date" : ISODate("2013-03-19T10:26:35Z"),
			"myState" : 1,
			"members" : [
			{
				"_id" : 0,
				"name" : "web2:2013",
				"health" : 1,
				"state" : 1,
				"stateStr" : "PRIMARY",
				"uptime" : 102,
				"optime" : Timestamp(1363688755000, 1),
				"optimeDate" : ISODate("2013-03-19T10:25:55Z"),
				"self" : true
			},
		{
				"_id" : 1,
				"name" : "web3:2013",
				"health" : 1,
				"state" : 2,
				"stateStr" : "SECONDARY",
				"uptime" : 40,
				"optime" : Timestamp(1363688755000, 1),
				"optimeDate" : ISODate("2013-03-19T10:25:55Z"),
				"lastHeartbeat" : ISODate("2013-03-19T10:26:33Z"),
				"pingMs" : 1
			}
		],
		"ok" : 1
		}


we can check the status of the Shards as follows: connect to the mongos service
'mongo localhost:8888/admin -u admin -p 123456' and issue the following command to get
the status of the Shards.


		 
		mongos> sh.status()
		--- Sharding Status --- 
		  sharding version: { "_id" : 1, "version" : 3 }
		  shards:
			{  "_id" : "web2",  "host" : "web2/web2:2013,web3:2013" }
			{  "_id" : "web3",  "host" : "web3/web2:2014,web3:2014" }
  		databases:
			{  "_id" : "admin",  "partitioned" : false,  "primary" : "config" }


###We can also make sure the Sharding works by creating a database,collection and populate it with documents and check if the chunks of the collection are balanced equally across nodes. The below diagram illustrates the verification step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Alt text](/mongodb/images/check.png "check")

The above mentioned steps can be tested with an automated playbook.

Issue the following command to run the test. In variable passed make sure the
servername is one of any mongos server.
		
		ansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/testsharding.yml -e servername=mongos


Once the playbook completes, we check if the shadring has succeded by logging
on to any mongos server and issuing the following command. The output display
the number of chunks spread across the shards.

		mongos> sh.status()
			--- Sharding Status --- 
  			sharding version: { "_id" : 1, "version" : 3 }
  			shards:
			{  "_id" : "bensible",  "host" : "bensible/bensible:20103,web2:20103,web3:20103" }
			{  "_id" : "web2",  "host" : "web2/bensible:20105,web2:20105,web3:20105" }
			{  "_id" : "web3",  "host" : "web3/bensible:20102,web2:20102,web3:20102" }
  			databases:
			{  "_id" : "admin",  "partitioned" : false,  "primary" : "config" }
			{  "_id" : "test",  "partitioned" : true,  "primary" : "web3" }
			
				test.test_collection chunks:
				
				bensible	7
				web2	6
				web3	7
			
			

 
### Scaling the Cluster
---------------------------------------

![Alt text](/mongodb/images/scale.png "scale")

To add a new node to the configured MongoDb Cluster, setup the inventory file as follows:

		#The site wide list of mongodb servers
		[mongoservers]
		mongo1 mongod_port=2700
		mongo2 mongod_port=2701
		mongo3 mongod_port=2702
		mongo4 mongod_port=2703

		#The list of servers where replication should happen, make sure the new node is listed here.
		[replicationservers]
		mongo4
		mongo3
		mongo1
		mongo2

		#The list of mongodb configuration servers, make sure it is 1 or 3
		[mongocservers]
		mongo1
		mongo2
		mongo3

		#The list of servers where mongos servers would run. 
		[mongosservers]
		mongos1
		mongos2

Make sure you have the new node added in the replicationservers section and
execute the following command:

		ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

###Verification.
-----------------------------

The verification of the newly added node can be as easy checking the sharding
status and see the chunks being rebalanced to the newly added node.

			$/usr/bin/mongo localhost:8888/admin -u admin -p 123456
			mongos> sh.status()
				--- Sharding Status --- 
  				sharding version: { "_id" : 1, "version" : 3 }
  			shards:
			{  "_id" : "bensible",  "host" : "bensible/bensible:20103,web2:20103,web3:20103" }
			{  "_id" : "web2",  "host" : "web2/bensible:20105,web2:20105,web3:20105" }
			{  "_id" : "web3",  "host" : "web3/bensible:20102,web2:20102,web3:20102" }
			{  "_id" : "web4",  "host" : "web4/bensible:20101,web3:20101,web4:20101" }
  			databases:
			{  "_id" : "admin",  "partitioned" : false,  "primary" : "config" }
			{  "_id" : "test",  "partitioned" : true,  "primary" : "bensible" }
		
			test.test_collection chunks:
			
				web4	3
				web3	6
				web2	6
				bensible	5
